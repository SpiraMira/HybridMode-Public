- October 3, 2018 : 
    - added screenshots for hybrid (light) mode with vibrant sidebars and (much) better looking title bars and tab bars. 
    - table columns are translucent but a dark grey, I still don't like - work in progress...
    - note: actual script hasn't been added yet but screenshots are available below
