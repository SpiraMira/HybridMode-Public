## Troubleshootinhg

If the system no longer boots:

- restart in [single-user mode](https://support.apple.com/en-bh/HT201573) or

  - For AppKit ```cd /S*/L*/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/Current```
  - For HIToolbox ```cd /S*/L*/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Frameworks/HITToolbox.framework/Versions/Current```
  - For CoreUI ```cd /S*/L*/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/Current```

  - For AppKit ```cd /S*/L*/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/Current```
  - For HIToolbox ```cd /S*/L*/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Frameworks/HITToolbox.framework/Versions/Current```
  - For CoreUI ```cd /S*/L*/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/Current```
